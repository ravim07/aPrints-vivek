            Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your

            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and
            online services to post a privacy policy. The law&#39;s reach stretches well beyond
            California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
            the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information
            from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website
            stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies
            with whom it is being shared.

            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
            requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails
            stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
